# Professional GitHub Workflow Guide

## Commit Message Standards

All commits must follow conventional commit format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts

### Examples:
```
feat(auth): add JWT token validation
fix(api): resolve memory leak in transaction processor
docs: update API documentation for v2.0
refactor(ml): optimize fraud detection algorithm
```

## Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description-of-feature`
- `bugfix/description-of-bug`
- `hotfix/critical-fix-description`
- `release/version-number`

## Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes with proper commit messages
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Submit PR with detailed description
6. Request code review
7. Address review feedback
8. Merge after approval

## Code Review Standards

- All code must be reviewed before merging
- Reviewer must check for:
  - Code quality and standards compliance
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Performance implications
  - Test coverage
  - Documentation updates

## Release Process

1. Create release branch
2. Update version numbers
3. Update CHANGELOG.md
4. Tag release with semantic version
5. Deploy to staging
6. Deploy to production after validation
